# HackMart Security Challenge Walkthrough

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a complete walkthrough of the HackMart Security Challenge, an intentionally vulnerable web application designed to practice web security testing based on OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.

The project demonstrates how different vulnerabilities can be identified and exploited in a controlled and educational environment.

##  Vulnerabilities Exploited
- SQL Injection (Authentication Bypass)
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Broken Access Control
- UNION-based SQL Injection

##  Tools & Technologies Used
- Burp Suite
- Web Browser (Firefox/Chrome)
- Kali Linux
- Manual testing techniques
- OWASP Top 10 guidelines

##  Learning Outcomes
- Practical experience with web application penetration testing
- Understanding OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
- Ability to document step-by-step exploitation process
- Improved ethical hacking and security analysis skills

##  Project Files
The complete walkthrough report is available in this repository as a PDF document.

##  Disclaimer
This project was conducted for educational and ethical hacking purposes only. All testing was performed in a controlled lab environment without causing harm to real systems.
